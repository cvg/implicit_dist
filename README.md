You can find the paper [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Pan_Camera_Pose_Estimation_Using_Implicit_Distortion_Models_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf), and the supplementary material [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/supplemental/Pan_Camera_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2022_supplemental.pdf).

This is a cleaned-up re-implementation of the code used to run the experiments in the paper. Please let us know if you find any bugs or have any trouble running it!


## Running the code
The python binding can be compiled by running

```
pip install .
```

This will install the module `pyimplicitdist`. See the [demo](demo.ipynb) notebook for details on how to run the code.
